# practice-java-selenium-testng
A basic test automation framework using Java, Selenium, and TestNG

The sample tests in this framework use 
[Parabank](https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm)

Each test class can contain one or more tests
* Tests in the same class will reuse the same browser to save time
